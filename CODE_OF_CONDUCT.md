# Code of Conduct - Unknown6656 Style

## Our Standards

We have none. Be as spicy as you want to be.<br/>
Like I'd give a fâ–ˆck.

## Our Code Standards

 - **Allman style.**
    End of discussion. Linux kernel / K&R bois can get the hell out.

 - You are encouraged to omit `{` and `}` around single-lined blocks<sup>[1]</sup>, e.g.:
    ```csharp
    if (true)
        func();

    do
        func();
    while (true);
    ```
    But do **not** write any of this crap:
    ```csharp
    if (true) func();
    
    do func(); while (true);
    ```
    Do **not** write any of that shite either:
    ```csharp
    if (true) { func(); }
    
    do { func(); } while (true);
    ```

 - `PascalCase` for types, methods, properties, public identifiers, etc.

 - `underscore_lower_case` for method parameters and local variables

 - `_underscore_lower_case` for private fields

 - `CAPS_LOCK_CASE` for constants

 - Document `public` and `protected` classes and members using XML comments. You do not have to document inaccessible/private members.

 - Try to avoid using external libraries or packages as much as possible. There are already enough dependencies in this project.
 
**To avoid any association with slavery, the `master`-branch has been renamed to `daddy` :wink:.**
